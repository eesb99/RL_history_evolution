# Common RL Algorithms and Their History and Evolution

---

### **1. Early RL Algorithms (Pre-2000s)**  
These algorithms laid the theoretical foundation for modern RL.

#### **a. Dynamic Programming (Bellman, 1950s)**
- **Key Idea**: Solve RL problems using recursive **Bellman Equations** for value functions.
- **Examples**:
  - **Value Iteration**: Iteratively update value functions for each state.
  - **Policy Iteration**: Alternate between policy evaluation and policy improvement.
- **Limitations**:
  - Requires a perfect model of the environment.
  - Computationally expensive for large state spaces.

#### **b. Temporal Difference (TD) Learning (1980s)**
- **Key Idea**: Combine dynamic programming with Monte Carlo methods to learn from incomplete episodes.
- **Example**: **TD(0)**.
- **Significance**: Introduced the concept of bootstrapping, estimating the value function from partial data.

#### **c. Q-Learning (1989)**  
- **Key Idea**: Learn an action-value function \( Q(s, a) \) to maximize expected reward without needing a model of the environment.
- **Algorithm**: Update \( Q(s, a) \) iteratively using:
  \[
  Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \big(r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)\big)
  \]
- **Limitations**: Struggles with high-dimensional state-action spaces and continuous spaces.

#### **d. SARSA (1996)**  
- **Key Idea**: A model-free, on-policy alternative to Q-learning that updates the Q-value based on the policy's current action:
  \[
  Q(s, a) \leftarrow Q(s, a) + \alpha \big(r + \gamma Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)\big)
  \]

### **2. Function Approximation and Early Neural Networks (1990s)**
- **Problem**: Classic algorithms struggled with high-dimensional state spaces.
- **Solution**: Introduce function approximation to generalize across states.
- **Notable Work**:
  - **TD-Gammon (1992)**: First use of neural networks in RL to train a backgammon-playing agent, developed by Gerald Tesauro.

---

### **3. Modern RL with Deep Learning (2010s)**  
This era integrated deep learning with RL to handle large state-action spaces.

#### **a. Deep Q-Networks (DQN, 2015)**  
- **Key Paper**: "Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning" (DeepMind).
- **Key Idea**: Combine Q-learning with deep neural networks to approximate \( Q(s, a) \).
- **Innovations**:
  - **Experience Replay**: Store past experiences in a buffer and sample them randomly to break correlation in training data.
  - **Target Networks**: Use a separate network to compute the target Q-value, improving stability.
- **Applications**: Mastered Atari games directly from pixels.

#### **b. Policy Gradient Methods**
- Address limitations of value-based methods like DQN by directly optimizing policies.
- **Examples**:
  - **REINFORCE (1992)**: Basic policy gradient algorithm using Monte Carlo estimation of returns.
  - **Actor-Critic Methods (2000s)**: Combine a policy model (actor) and a value function (critic) to reduce variance in gradient estimation.

#### **c. Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO, 2015)**  
- **Key Paper**: "Trust Region Policy Optimization" (Schulman et al.).
- **Key Idea**: Constrain policy updates to stay within a trust region, ensuring stable updates and avoiding catastrophic policy changes.
- **Limitation**: Computationally expensive due to second-order optimization.

#### **d. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO, 2017)**  
- **Key Paper**: "Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms" (Schulman et al.).
- **Key Idea**: Simplify TRPO by replacing trust-region constraints with a clipping mechanism in the objective function.
- **Advantages**: Easier to implement and scales well for large-scale applications.

#### **e. Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C/A3C, 2016)**  
- **Key Idea**: Extend actor-critic methods by asynchronously training multiple agents in parallel environments.
- **Advantage**: Faster convergence due to parallelization.

### **4. Evolution to Model-Based RL (Late 2010s - Present)**  
- **Problem**: Model-free methods are sample-inefficient, requiring millions of interactions with the environment.
- **Solution**: Leverage a learned model of the environment to improve sample efficiency.
- **Notable Algorithms**:
  - **World Models (2018)**: Learn a generative model of the environment to simulate and plan.
  - **Model-Based Value Expansion (MBVE, 2019)**: Use short-term rollouts from a learned model to augment training.

---

### **5. Multi-Agent RL (MARL)**  
- **Key Challenge**: Environments with multiple interacting agents (e.g., cooperative or competitive games).
- **Notable Algorithms**:
  - **Independent Q-Learning (IQL)**: Treat each agent as an independent Q-learner.
  - **Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG, 2017)**: Extend DDPG for multi-agent settings by including other agentsâ€™ actions in the critic.

---

### **6. RL with Human Feedback (2020s)**  
- **Key Development**: Combine RL with human feedback to train AI systems aligned with human preferences.
- **Examples**:
  - **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)**: Used to train large language models like ChatGPT.
